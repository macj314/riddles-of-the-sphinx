// Create a console application where the Sphinx asks a riddle and the user must answer the riddle correctly. 
//    If the riddle is answered correctly, the Sphinx asks a second riddle and so on.
// Start with one riddle. If the user answers correctly, the Sphinx is defeated. If the user is incorrect, the Sphinx eats the user.
// Once the application is working with a single riddle, add a few more.
// Try writing a method to randomize which riddle the Sphinx asks.
